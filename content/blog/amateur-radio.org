I have decided to study for the Amateur Radio Foundation License.

I did do some training in the past with [[https://www.essexham.co.uk/train/][Ham Train]] but didn't take the examination for various personal reasons.

I will not take any more formal training, at least not yet, but will study from the official [[https://rsgb.org/][RSGB]] Foundation License Manual.

I do not know how long this will take as I am sure that I will get distracted at times but I do aim to get my license this time around.
