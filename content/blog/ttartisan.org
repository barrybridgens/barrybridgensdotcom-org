I purchased a TTArtsan 25mm f2 manual focus lens after seeing a review of it on Mark Wiemels' YouTube channel  that sang its praises (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDt8I7QrgE4).

When it arrived I put it on my Fuji X-E3 to test it out

I took the camera and lens into Birmingham to do some "street photography". Below are some of the images that I took. All are "straight out of camera" JPEGs.

The lens worked very well, especially with the focus peaking of the X-E3.

I enjoyed the experience of using this lens and liked the results that it produced. I will certainly be taking it out again.
