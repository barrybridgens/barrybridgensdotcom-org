#+TITLE: Big Film Photo Walk
#+DATE: <2025-03-16 Sun>

A little late I know but ...

Back in June 2024 I took part in [[https://analoguewonderland.co.uk/blogs/store-news/the-big-film-photowalk-details][The Big Film Photowalk]] which was sponsored by [[https://analoguewonderland.co.uk/][Analogue Wonderland]], [[https://www.kodak.com/en/][Kodak]] and [[https://pentax.eu/][Pentax]]. The event ran simultaneously at 40 locations across the UK. I joined the Birmingham walk which was lead by Alex Davidson (@ae1alex - instagram [[https://www.the3rs.uk][www.the3rs.uk]]).

I was not sure which camera to to take and so ended up taking two; the Canon EOS3 and the Olympus OM4. When I arrived at the meeting point I noticed that most of the people were using manual focus cameras and so I went to the OM4. A roll of film and the film processing were included in the entry price. Alex lead us on a great route around the city, including the markets, the library and the main shopping streets. After a quick drink we all went home to wait for the films to be processed and returned.

There was a photo competition associated with the photowalk and one of my images (below) got an "honorable mention"!
