#+TITLE: Haiku

To (sort of) continue the vintage computing vibe, I have been playing with [[https://www.haiku-os.org/][Haiku]].

To quote the web-site, "Haiku is an open-source operating system that specifically targets personal computing. Inspired by the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeOS][BeOS]], Haiku is fast, simple to use, easy to learn and yet very powerful."

I am currently running Haiku in a virtual machine (using [[https://github.com/quickemu-project/quickemu][Quickemu]]) on my NixOS Linux laptop.

The standard Haiku distribution comes with a reasonable number of applications / demos and a lot of documentation.

To allow software development the system comes with a C compiler and Python already installed. Bellow is a quick test of the C compiler.

The standard distribution of Haiku does cover all of the bases to be a "daily driver" but does come with a usable web browser called Webpositive and has a "software store" called HaikuDepot where more software can be installed.

Haiku makes a nice change from standard Linux distributions while still having some familiar touches, for example it uses bash and gcc. I will continue to use it.

I would like to also try it on real hardware at some point, watch this space!
