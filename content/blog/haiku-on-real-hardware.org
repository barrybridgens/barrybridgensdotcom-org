#+TITLE: Haiku on Real Hardware
#+DATE: <2025-01-12 Sun>

After playing with Haiku in a virtual machine I wanted to try in on real hardware. I tried with a couple of my very old laptops but it would either not run at all or did not recognise the internal disk and so could not be installed.

I then decided to use one of my favorite old laptops, the Thinkpad x220.

Thinkpads are one of the best supported laptops for alternative operating systems and the X220 did not let me down. Initially I had some issues getting it to boot from the internal disk but that was because I missed the step in the installation of installing the Haiku bootloader. Once this was corrected the system booted.

Haiku runs really well on the X220. WiFi works, the battery life appears to be OK, although I have not fully tested this, and the system is very snappy.

As others have similarly commented, I could see myself using Haiku on the X220 if I wanted to do some writing or coding without the distractions inherent in my normal Linux setups.
